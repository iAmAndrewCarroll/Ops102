## SSH Protocol

**1. What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?**
   - SSH Protocol (Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login.
   - It provides strong authentication options.
   - It uses robust encryption for communication security and integrity.

**2. What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?**
   - Providing secure access for users and automated processes.
   - Conducting interactive and automated file transfers.
   - Issuing remote commands.
   - Managing network infrastructure and mission-critical system components.

**3. How does the SSH protocol work?**
   - Operates in a client-server model.
   - SSH client initiates the connection to the SSH server.
   - Utilizes public key cryptography for server verification.
   - Employs strong symmetric encryption and hashing algorithms for data privacy and integrity.

**4. How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?**
   - Negotiates encryption parameters during setup.
   - Uses industry-standard strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES).
   - Ensures data integrity with standard hash algorithms (e.g., SHA-2).
   - This combination safeguards data during transmission.

## RDP Protocol

**1. What is Windows Remote Desktop Connection?**
   - Windows Remote Desktop Connection is a tool provided by Microsoft.
   - It allows users to connect to remote Windows PCs or servers.
   - Provides full access to software and tools on the remote device.
   - Enables remote control as if the user were physically present.

**2. What is RDP?**
   - RDP stands for Remote Desktop Protocol.
   - It is developed by Microsoft.
   - RDP allows remote users to view and use Windows on a remote device.
   - It shares essential peripherals like the keyboard and mouse.
   - Requires both an RDP server (remote device being controlled) and an RDP client (controlling device).
   - Specific to Windows and compatible with Windows PCs and Windows Server installations.

**3. What is the RDP port number?**
   - The RDP port number used is 3389.
   - This port is well-known in the context of remote desktop solutions.
   - It's regularly scanned for potential exploits, making security measures crucial when using RDP over the internet.
