### China's Spy Chip

**How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?**
- A hardware hack involves the physical manipulation of computer components, while a software hack exploits software vulnerabilities.

**What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?**
- Spies can alter hardware through interdiction during transit or by seeding changes during manufacturing.

**Explain how the hack worked:**
- Microchips were covertly added to server motherboards during manufacturing in China, allowing unauthorized network access by intercepting and manipulating data.

**How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?**
- Investigators used intercepted communications, informants, and phone tracking to identify a unit in China's People's Liberation Army responsible for the chip insertions during manufacturing.

**Things I want to know more about:**
- How to penetrate everything and pitch these skills to corporations and small businesses in an effort to increase the security of the end users data.
